# Tseitin Cli

Tseitin CLI enables you to transform boolean equations into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with the [Tseitin-Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseytin_transformation) via a command line interface.

The project is in early development atm.

Following general features are to be added:
- documentation
- testing
- `--help`
- precedence of operators
- other operators (e.g. implication `=>`)
- log messages for debugging
- show relation between new variables from tseitin expression and the expression they represent
